##Shade Mapping of Trees on UBC Campus
In my project, I would have used the README file to explain to other people why your project is useful, what they can do with my project, and how they can use it.
For instance, I processed Lidar dara to calculate tree shades falling on buildings. This file would have been the best place for me to expain in details how to filter the and perform all the overlay analysis to calculate the tree shades on buuildings.
